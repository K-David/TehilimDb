# TehilimDb
This repository contains a programmatically created dataset of OpenLyric songs for use by the various applications. Contributions will likely not be merged in at this time as the structure and layout are still a work in progress. A program is under development that will simplify making contributions and contributions will likely require its use to maintain continuity with the other applications.

All songs in the Tehilim Db must Be in the public Domain, have a copyright permisive of use for public worship or have the lyric authors permission explicit permission. Part of the reason for using GitHub is so that contributions can be tracked and any copyright violations that occur can be traced to a specific contributor. If the publisher\ Authour of the song does not want the lyrics of the song used in public worship (without being paid) then we do not wish to have those songs included in this database.
